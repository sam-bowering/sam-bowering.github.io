                        <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
                        <p>Okay right, let me get this straight for anyone who doesn't believe in magic... You've just been horribly humiliated so suck eggs. Yes, I know... The video creator specifically mentioned it wasn't magic, but lets be honest, one word - Proppaganda. Just try and tell me sitting on your ass thinking about doing something and physically getting better at that skill isn't MAGIC.</p>
                        <p>Neuroplasticity spells saviour for a crazy number of people suffering ranging from depression and addictions to strokes. Oh you didn't catch that? S T R O K E S. With a resume like that, I'd say it's nothing short of a modern day miracle. Just think about it for a minute. Your brain can completely forget how to function a part of your body, and simply by having the perservance to THINK about getting better; you can completely reverse the lose and regain FULL control. In simple terms, that's straight up combatting a hemorrage in your brain by thinking to yourself "Nah, gimme that back". Crazy stuff, and it's insane to think everyone isn't practising techniques like this everyday.</p>
                        <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
                        <p>Psychologist, Professor Carol Dweck's Ted Talk on the topic was incredible. Her research is single-handedly changing lives of young people and reshaping their views on how to succeed. They've now adopted the mindset that if they fail, that's not the end of the road, but a small chicane. Instead of saying "I'm never going to get this" they're saying "I haven't quite got this yet". Dweck put heavy emphasis on the power of yet and she's exactly right to do so. She's turned a simple three letter word "yet" into a weapon of mass knowledge collection for anyone to use free of charge. All you've got to do is say "Not yet".</p>
