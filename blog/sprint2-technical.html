						<h1>What Are They and What Do They Do?</h1>
						<p class="text-pre-trans">Classes and ID's are selectors. Selectors simply allow you to style and format an HTML element in css.</p>
						<p class="trans">(Translation: Classes and ID's are a tool to make an aspect of a website look how you want it to)</p>
						<h1>Okay Sooo, What's the Difference?</h1>
						<p class="text-pre-trans">The defining difference boils down to how much use the element will get. To use the index page of this blog as an example:</p>
						<img src="styles/images/classvsid-1.png" alt="Difference - Code" id="classvsid-img-1">
						<img src="styles/images/classvsvid-2.png" alt="Difference - Website" id="classvsid-img-2">
						<p class="text-pre-trans">Each element marked <font color="yellow">yellow</font> is only used once; both in the HTML file and the web page. These elements only need to appear once  
						    because they are core structural aspects of the page that have no need to have multiples of such as, the header, navigation bar, cluster of links and the 
						    main body of the page below the header. These are the <font color="yellow">ID's</font>.</p>
						<p class="trans">(Translation: Everything with a <font color="#e5e500">yellow</font> line through it is an <font color="#e5e500">ID</font>. These things only appear ONCE and are UNIQUE)</p>
						<p class="text-pre-trans">The other elements marked <font color="red">red</font> are used multiple times throughout the web page and HTML file. The <font color="red">class</font> selector 
						    elements are specifically elements you want to display more than once and with the exact same formatting.</p>
						<p class="trans">(Translation: Everything with a <font color="#e50000">red</font> line through it is a <font color="#e50000">class</font>. These things appear MULTIPLE times and are all the SAME)</p>
						<h1>What do they look like Behind the Scenes?</h1>
						<p>You've seen how they're written in HTML, but not yet in css.</p>
						<img src="styles/images/classvsid-3.png" alt="Difference - CSS" id="classvsid-img-3">
						<div id="text-right">
							<p>The difference between defining an <font color="yellow">ID</font> versus a <font color="red">class</font> is extremely 
								simple and won't need translation. You'll understand soon, as any 
								content starting with a hash '#' is an <font color="yellow">ID</font> and yes, you genius, you 
								guessed it; anything starting with a fullstop '.' is a <font color="red">class</font>. If you had to 
								go digging through the dictionary to figure that one out, all I can say 
								is I'm worried.</p>
							<h1>But... Wait? Does CSS even care?</h1>
							<p class="text-pre-trans">NOPE! HA! According to Chris Coyier, at CSS-Tricks <font color="orange">"Regarding CSS, 
								there is nothing you can do with an ID that you can't do with a Class 
								and vise versa. I remember when I was first learning CSS and I was 
								having a problem, sometimes I would try and troubleshoot by switch
								ing around these values. Nope. CSS doesn't care."</font></p>
							<p class="trans">Translation: Javascript, another programming language. Oh, you 
								know the one? Yeah doesn't care...</p>
							<h1>Carrying on...</h1>
							<p class="text-pre-trans">Don't mind the progressively increasing angst... Elements do care! :D 
							   There is nothing stopping you from having both an <font color="yellow">ID</font> and a <font color="red">Class</font> on 
							   a single element. Orrr, even <font color="lime">nesting</font> an <font color="yellow">ID</font> inside an <font color="yellow">ID</font> or a <font color="red">Class</font> 
							   inside a <font color="red">Class</font>.</p>
							<p class="trans">Translation: I can't sit down and write without getting way too chatty 
							   in my writing. Oh, and it is a-okay to place either an <font color="#e5e500">ID</font> or <font color="#e50000">red</font> inside of 
							   itself to tinker with formatting within a custom formatted element.</p>
							<h1>Summary</h1>
							<p class="text-pre-trans">To conclude; <font color="red">Classes</font> <font color="yellow">ID's</font> are selectors that serve as formatting links 
							   between HTML and other languages to shape elements to personal 
							   liking; <font color="red">'#'</font> is used for <font color="red">Classes</font> and <font color="yellow">'.'</font> is used for <font color="yellow">ID's</font>; the defining 
							   difference is whether the custom element is used one or more times and 
							   <font color="lime">nesting</font> is fully supported to allow you to further customize 
							   formatting within an element.</p>
							<p class="trans">Translation: <font color="#e50000">Classes</font> and <font color="#e5e500">ID's</font> are tools used to customize parts of a webpage to personal preference and can be used in combination to customize to ones desire.</p>
