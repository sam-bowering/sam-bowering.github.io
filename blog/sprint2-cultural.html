						<h1>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h1>
						<p>Robotics, artificial intelligence or private security sector. There’s nothing I’d love to do more than get front-line soldiers off the streets and have hunks of metal with a couple computers in them risk their shiny polishes than fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters lives. </p>
						<h1>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h1>
						<p>Interview skills and working with people I don’t share the same views with. Whenever I’m talking to someone with strong opposing views to those I hold myself, I quickly find myself feeling this disgusting sense of hatred and my brain instantly switches to not hearing anything the person says whether it makes sense or not and immediately dismisses it.</p>
						<h1>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h1>
						<p><a href="https://sam-bowering.github.io/blog/sprint1-cultural.html">Strengths and Weakness Blog</a> - Here I talk about my strengths and weakness being overthinking, find it difficult to focus, highly emotional but also curious, know how to relax and one I left out, appreciation of beauty. I personally believe my weakness are completely controllable and only show their face when my strengths don’t quite pull through. I like to think of myself as someone who can put their all into a task but also hold the ability to step away from it and appreciate what’s been achieved by myself and or others. When I mentioned I believed my emotions are controllable, I meant that in the sense that if I sat and thought on what I was doing/about to do, I would understand whatever that was is wrong and consciously choose not to do it. But no ones perfect and there isn’t enough time in the world to stop and second guess everything you do.
						</p>
						<h1>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safety with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h1>
						<p>Honestly all this requires is for me to sit down and have a serious talk with myself about the things I’m going to have to say no to and how much time I will have to put into bootcamp (which I’m picking is going to be ummm, all of it).</p>
						<h1>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h1>
						<p>Anywhere I can get it from? If you need a question answered… Ask. Doing so in a timely way would simply be asking someone face to face that I think will be able to answer my question.</p>
						<h1>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h1>
						<p>All I expect from the facilitation team is to be there when needed to guide us back on track. They’re only human and although they may seem like walking programming encyclopedias, they’ve got lives just as important as ours.</p>
						<h1>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h1>
						<p>Family would be the only block-out times I’d need but I’m not too sure on how much time I can give to them as of yet.</p>
