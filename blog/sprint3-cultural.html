							Emotional Intelligence(EQ) is the way we humans interact with one another in a social environment. Without it, we would all 
							likely speak in some really sick monotone voice that would be suuuper captivating beyond words...
						</p>
						<p>
							Improving and having a high EQ is extremely valuable - especially in today's world. Employers are now starting to take into 
							account how a potential employee can work in a team over how skilled they are or even their IQ. For young developers looking to make a break
							onto the scene this is a crucial skill to develop. Those who think otherwise will be regretting it once they get into a team and begin 
							to realise they can't relate, empathize or even simply get along with others.
						</p>
						<p>
							In summary, emotional intelligence is a key trait to improve both personal and professional interactions as understanding it 
							aids in relating to others and their feelings. This ability makes you an excellent candidate in the eyes of both an employer and a 
							friend.
