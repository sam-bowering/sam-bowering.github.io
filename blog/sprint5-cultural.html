                            <h1>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of core learning?</h1>
                            <p>I never realised how critical I could be of myself and that I should always speak to myself as if I was speaking to someone else when they're struggling instead of beating myself up. Secondly, my learning style is very much hands on focused. I've got to be right there soaking it all in to get interested and retain the knowledge so remote learning has been really hard for me. Lastly, my ego has been humbled by the core content covered over these past five weeks. I've developed a broader understanding of how people learn and the processes that are required for each unique individual.</p>
                            <h1>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h1>
                            <p>I was surprised with how engaging it was and how much time I'd spend outside of the course material thinking about it. I really expected to have to push myself to get the core work done but in reality it was the complete opposite.</p>
                            <h1>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h1>
                            <p>The self reflection started off as a real challenge for me as I'd never done anything like it before and I'd be raised with the idea of not looking back to your past shortfalls. I've now come to realise it's a core part of creating a better version of yourself in the future.</p>
                            <h1>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h1>
                            <p>I'm not sure if this is why, but it seems to be to help us as students become more hireable by companies. Recruiters these days are looking for more well-rounded people that can effectively work in team environments rather than a workaholic that grinds day in day out by themselves.</p>
                            <h1>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead?</h1>
                            <p>No, as I've mentioned over these last few answers I don't see it as a waste of time at all and really appreciate my time spent honing my cultural skills as I think they'll be one of my greatest assests in the future for both my professional and personal life.</p>
