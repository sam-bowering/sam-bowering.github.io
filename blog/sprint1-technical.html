						Credibility:
High school in this day and age can be a VERY interesting time for a malleable young mind and if there’s one thing I’ve noticed, it’s people tend to shape their identity, values and strengths into what they think will make them look better to others and call on a different set when the time suits. I was far from an exception to this and I’m making a conscious effort to reverse the high school popularity game mentality. I like to stick to my guns and maintain my personal values to the highest degree, changing for nothing.
Tenacity:
As I’m sure we’re all aware, life can sling a hell of a curve ball every once and awhile. When this comes you need the tenacity to brave the storm and smack that puppy out of the park.
Just last year, my friends and I finished our last year of high school. They all seemed to have to figured out. They knew what they wanted to do and where they were going to do it. Myself on the other hand had about fifty vague ideas floating around and I could never seem to pin down just one. Seeing them all talking about being accepted into their respective universities and applying for hall residence got me feeling really left out and actually ended up with me caving under that insecurity and applying for a course that would’ve had me bored out of my brains - but the thought process was purely fitting in with the rest. But tenacity, as late as it seemed to grow, finally kicked in and gave me the confidence to break away from my insecurities and find what I really wanted to follow. So off they went. One by one our friend group of 23 I saw on a daily basis diminished to 5 I barely saw a handful of times. At first I thought “Hey, this isn’t too bad” since I figured the band-aid had been ripped off and it was only smooth sailing from here. Well, turns out I could’ve been more wrong if I tried… Being a social person and someone that loves sharing experiences with people; going from all the friends to a big fat none of them was insanely difficult. My mind toyed with me right up until early June of this year about how I’d made the wrong choice, I was going to be stuck working in a job slowly picking off my brain cells one by one and everyone of my friends off at uni was living the dream that wouldn’t end.
Let me be the first one to tell you if you didn’t already know. A person's own brain is R-E-L-E-N-T-L-E-S-S when you get it working on how much it sucks. You can form insecurities completely out of the blue that you never would’ve even considered normally and that was an incredibly scary thing for me over the previous six months. But enough of the sob story. I’m here now and loving this course because I found the strength in myself to carry on trudging through the mud. This solemn reason is why I put the power of tenacity so high on my personal values list.
Trust:
Without trust this world would be an absolute mess. Relationships wouldn’t last a day, families would fall apart and friendships would be laughed at. Trust is one of those vital elements of society take keeps it ticking. To me, trust is binding value that brings and sticks people together. Trust let’s you completely rely on someone to always be there for you, look out for your wellbeing, give a shoulder to cry on and count on for anything. Personally, I also see trust coupled with most if not every other value relating to sharing a healthy bond with another person. To love, you need trust; to build a friendship, you need trust; to effectively communicate, you need trust.
Strengths and Weaknesses:
The Briggs Myer personality traits website 16 personalities (<--- Link this in actual page) placed me as a Campaigner (ENTP-T) (<--- Same deal) and after reading this scarily accurate description, it’s highlighted some very key weaknesses that I definitely need to address.
Overthink Things - I overthink e v e r y t h i n g there is that the brain can fathom… 
Find it Difficult to Focus - If I don’t particularly enjoy what I’m doing or have to do, I find it almost impossible to focus on it.
