                        <h1>Dicussion:</h1>
                        <p>Got blocked on a simple problem?</p>
                        <p>A lot of the time I got stuck on a simple problem, all it required was to look at it from a different angle.</p>
                        <p>Solved a problem in an elegant way?</p>
                        <p>Yeah ehhhh, the majority of my problem solving so far hasn't been the most elegant until I've searched it up and taken bits of others code and changed it to suit myself.</p>
                        <p>What was the problem?</p>
                        <p>Honestly just trying to wrap my head around built-in string and array methods was super confusing. The syntax and everything was a little different from other things and really spun me out a bit.</p>
                        <p>What problem solving techniques did you use?</p>
                        <p>Google, google and more google. Google is the best friend I never knew I had.</p>
                        <p>Mostly confused, as has been the general consensus throughout the course and I doubt will change any time soon.</p>
                        <p>I learnt the basic in's and out's of how the methods work and the syntax they use.</p>
                        <h1>Reflection:</h1>
                        <p>Pseuodocode is really helpful to get your ideas how and what you're trying to accomplish down so you can read it through and take on the problem step by step.</p>
                        <p>Trying something is great when you know what you're doing and that's 100% not a huge commmodity in foundations (at least for myself).</p>
                        <p>I find the Rubby Ducky method and pseudocoding to be equally as helpful as it's just posing problems and solutions to yourself to see how they sound and how to solve them.</p>
                        <p>Reading error messages at this stage is pretty daunting as it evolves a fair amount of jargon but sometimes it can be helpful for identifying small mistakes in certain places you miss when glancing over your code.</p>
                        <p>I personally don't use console.logging as I've always found a more effective alternative to figure out what's going wrong.</p>
                        <p>Googling is the best thing in the world and a good website that explains things in a clear and clean cut way is like the holy grail for programming students.</p>
                        <p>This cohort has been fanstatic in helping each other out and I can't wait to see how we go in bootcamp.</p>
                        <p>I haven't personally asked any coaches for help but my faciliator has been phenomenal at chilling me out and keeping my head in reality.</p>
                        <p>Reflection has been oddly liberating for me. I've never really kept record of anything I've done before and it's quite calming explaining something in reflection and seeing first-hand that you actually know what you're talking about for a change.</p>
